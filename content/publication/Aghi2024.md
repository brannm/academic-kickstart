abstract: We have recently proposed experimental design guidelines and areas of study for preclinical rodent models of gender-affirming hormone therapy in neuroscience. These guidelines also apply to any field subject to the influences of gonadal steroid hormones, including metabolism and growth, cancer, and physiology. This perspective briefly describes our suggestions for these fields. Studying the effects of exogenous steroid hormones will have translational benefits for the community. We also discuss the need for equitable practices for cisgender scientists who wish to implement these guidelines and engage with the community. It is necessary that community-informed practices are implemented in preclinical research to maximize the benefit to transgender, nonbinary, and/or gender diverse (TNG) healthcare, which is currently in jeopardy in the United States, Europe, and across the globe.
