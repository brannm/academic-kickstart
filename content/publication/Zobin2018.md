abstract: Endometriosis is an estrogen dependent, inflammatory disorder occurring in 5â€“10% of reproductive-aged women. Women with endometriosis have a lower body mass index (BMI) and decreased body fat compared to those without the disease, yet few studies have focused on the metabolic abnormalities in adipose tissue in women with endometriosis. Previously, we identified microRNAs that are differentially expressed in endometriosis and altered in the serum of women with the disease. Here we explore the effect of endometriosis on fat tissue and identified a role for endometriosis-related microRNAs in fat metabolism and a reduction in adipocyte stem cell number.
