abstract: Summary We examined serum IGF-1 in premenopausal IOP, finding relationships that were opposite to those expected:
higher IGF-1 was associated with lower bone formation and higher body fat, and lower BMD response to teriparatide. These
paradoxical relationships between serum IGF-1, bone, and fat may contribute to the mechanism of idiopathic osteoporosis
in premenopausal women.
Introduction Premenopausal women with idiopathic osteoporosis (IOP) have marked deficits in bone microarchitecture
but variable bone remodeling. We previously reported that those with low tissue-level bone formation rate (BFR) are less
responsive to teriparatide and have higher serum IGF-1, a hormone anabolic for osteoblasts and other tissues. The IGF-1
data were unexpected because IGF-1 is low in other forms of low turnover osteoporosis—leading us to hypothesize that
IGF-1 relationships are paradoxical in IOP. This study aimed to determine whether IOP women with low BFR have higher
IGF-1 and paradoxical IGF-1 relationships in skeletal and non-skeletal tissues, and whether IGF-1 and the related measures
predict teriparatide response.
Methods This research is an ancillary study to a 24 month clinical trial of teriparatide for IOP. Baseline assessments were
related to trial outcomes: BMD, bone remodeling. Subjects: Premenopausal women with IOP(n = 34); bone remodeling status
was defined by baseline cancellous BFR/BS on bone biopsy. Measures: Serum IGF-1 parameters, compartmental adiposity
(DXA, CT, MRI), serum hormones, and cardiovascular-risk-markers related to fat distribution.
Results As seen in other populations, lower BFR was associated with higher body fat and poorer teriparatide response.
However, in contrast to observations in other populations, low BFR, higher body fat, and poorer teriparatide response were
all related to higher IGF-1: IGF-1 Z-score was inversely related to BFR at all bone surfaces (r = − 0.39 to − 0.46; p < 0.05),
directly related to central fat (p = 0.05) and leptin (p = 0.03). IGF-1 inversely related to 24 month hip BMD %change
(r = − 0.46; p = 0.01).
Conclusions Paradoxical IGF-1 relationships suggest that abnormal or atypical regulation of bone and fat may contribute to
osteoporosis mechanisms in premenopausal IOP.
