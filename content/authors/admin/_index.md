Dr. Teddy G. Goetz (they/them) is a psychiatry resident at the [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.med.upenn.edu/psychres/) and affiliated with the [Eidos LGBTQ+ Health initiative](https://penneidos.org/). Prior to earning their M.D. at Columbia, they studied biochemistry and gender studies at Yale, conducting research on a wide spectrum of biologically- and socially-determined aspects of gender-based health disparities, including earning their M.S. developing the first animal model of gender-affirming hormone therapy. Their current projects include implementation science research on TNG mental health, as well as narrative medicine and physician advocacy. Their lived experience as a non-binary/trans, queer, neurodivergent, chronically ill, Jewish person informs their writing, research, and clinical work.

They recently published a poetry chapbook [TRANS-abdominal Retrieval: a (gender)queer Jewish quest to make an embryo](https://beyondtheveilpress.com/) (Beyond the Veil Press, 2023), and have two forthcoming books: [Gender-Affirming Psychiatric Care](https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/gender-affirming-psychiatric-care-teddy-g-goetz-md-ms/1143188824), the first textbook on psychiatric care for transgender, non-binary, and/or gender expansive (TNG) communities (American Psychiatric Association Publishing, November 2023); [Gender is Really Strange](https://us.jkp.com/products/gender-is-really-strange?_pos=1&_psq=gender+is+really+str&_ss=e&_v=1.0), a graphic novel about the rich complexities of gender—sociocultural to neuroscience (Jessica Kinglsey Publishers, October 2023).
